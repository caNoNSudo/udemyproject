    <p>
      Chickens are susceptible to several parasites, including lice, mites,
      ticks, fleas, and intestinal worms, as well as other diseases. Despite the
      name, they are not affected by chickenpox, which is generally restricted
      to humans.<a

      Chickens can carry and transmit salmonella in their dander and feces. In
      the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise
      against bringing them indoors or letting small children handle them.<a
